# 🧠 Sellogy: Behavioral Pricing Engine

**Sellogy** is a specialized pricing tool for the premium resale market. It bridges the gap between **Profit Margins** and **Consumer Psychology**, ensuring that high-equity items are priced to convert without devaluing the brand.

### The Psychology of the Tiers:
* **Designer (Khaite/Jeanerica):** Uses **Prestige Rounding** ($160). High-end buyers equate round numbers with luxury and "Processing Fluency."
* **Premium (ReDone/Mother):** Uses **Clean-End Pricing** ($115). Signals boutique quality while maintaining a competitive edge.
* **Mid-Tier (J.Crew/Madewell):** Leverages the **Left-Digit Effect** ($49.99) to win the comparison-shopping battle.
* **Commodity (Nike/Zara):** Triggers **Clearance Signaling** ($34.95) to communicate "Final Markdown" for high-volume inventory.

### Technical Stack:
* **Language:** Python
* **Framework:** Streamlit
* **Logic:** Reverse-engineered eBay fee math + Behavioral Heuristics.
